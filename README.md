Life
====
The game of life

Building
========
This is built using `corebuild -pkg graphics life_callable.native`

Running
=======
Several initial configurations can be seen in `starts/`. As an example, to run
the R-pentomino, with one second between each frame and fairly large blocks,
the command is

`./life_callable --t 1 --scale 5 starts/rpentomino.start`
